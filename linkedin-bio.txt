Imagine a hands-on technologist who writes books, passionately believes in the power of ecosystems, and joins established companies at crucial growth stages to lead cross-functional teams tasked with powering the future of the business. That's me!

The next global information revolution driven by artificial intelligence presents companies with an opportunity to get their data strategies right, create a digital work culture across organizational boundaries, and focus on outcomes that move the needle. I work on all sides of the story to make that happen.

I've learned a lot from my engagements in media, telco, e-commerce, healthcare, financial services, education, and manufacturing. Giving back and inspiring others is something I deeply care about, that's why I share my experiences and knowledge to help the next generation of technologists so they can do what I do â€“ and more!
