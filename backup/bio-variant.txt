Uli has been working with data engineering & distributed systems since the early days of the internet. Previously with companies including Microsoft, Red Hat, Yahoo! and IBM, he now works on transforming the fashion industry for a more sustainable future as VP Engineering at Vestiaire Collective, bringing in project experience in financial services, media, healthcare, education, and the public sector.

With Singapore as a home base since twelve years, Uli originally grew up in Johannes Gutenberg's neighbourhood of Germany â€“ you could say it was the Silicon Valley of the 15th century. He usually doesn't have a beard, but he shares the same passion for everything at the intersection of technology, content, design & repeatability. Uli studied computer science and electrical engineering, and enjoys spending free time on the piano, over a book, or a walk at the sea to catch the sunrise.
